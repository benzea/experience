General Infos
=============

This is the eXperience GTK-2 engine. Created by Benjamin Berg
<benjamin@sipsolutions.net> with some help of his brother Johannes.

This engine is a new GTK-2 engine, to create pixmap based themes. It is
much more flexible than the old pixbuf (aka. pixmap) engine. It allows
to draw widget as a stack of multiple images. The recolor command gives
you the possibility to easily customize the colors used throughout the theme.

To have a glance at the impressive features of this engine, you should
have a look at the different color schemes of the eXperience GTK-Theme.

Bugs
====

Known Bugs:
 * Galeon crashes here after viewing File->Properties->Images and then
   closing the window. Don't know if this is actually a bug of the engine,
   or is just caused by something else. But it only happens with the
   eXperience theme as far as I know.
 * Some icons are broken. (This is gdk bug #306364)
 * It is slow ... (not really a bug, but I don't want to get mails about it,
   except maybe suggestions, how to get it faster.)

If you happen to find any other bugs, please contact me.

Installing
==========

You might need to run ./configure with --prefix=/usr, so that the engine
will be found by gtk.

Deinstalling
============

To deinstall the engine delete the created libexperience.so and
libexperience.la files.
You will probably find them in /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/engines/


Debian
======

There is a debian (i386 only) package available from:
deb http://benjamin.sipsolutions.net/debian/ unstable/

In the repository there are also packages for the eXperience GTK-Theme and
the eXperience icon theme.

Theming
=======

I have created some description about the engine and its features at
http://benjamin.sipsolutions.net/Projects/eXperience
There you find the different possible options for images, groups, etc.

If you have any questions, or problems please mail me!
