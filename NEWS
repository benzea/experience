25.08.2005 (0.10.0)
 * Fixed a lot of leaks. Some of them critical.

07.08.2005
 * Added some experimental code so that it is possible to visually group
   buttons in toolbars, etc.

04.08.2005 (0.9.8)
 * Releasing the different bugfixes.

01.08.2005
 * Bugfix. Now gcalctool works correctly (and maybe other apps)

31.07.2005
 * Fixed a bad bug. Found it only by accident though.

30.07.2005 (0.9.7)
 * Cleaned up some error messages in filter.c

28.07.2005
 * menu_items are now also drawn as box_gap. (As before the menus)

19.06.2005
 * Added support for * and ? in the detail string, and program name. This
   might be usefull for the program name matching.

13.06.2005
 * Added a small speedup, by saving some GdkPixbuf creations.
   (Removed again, since it doesn't work.)

01.06.2005 (0.9.6)
 * Added possibility to match against the program name.
   eg. program = "zenity", "abiword"

28.05.2005
 * warnings in filter.c are now usefull.

25.05.2005
 * Fills can now have an opacity. (A temporary image will be created.)
 * Fills can inherit from images and vice versa.
 * Fixed a bug introduced by the above feature. A fill would inherit the
   mirror option of an image. This is now disabled.

05/15/2005 (0.9.5)
 * This release adds support for checking any propertie of widgets.
   This can be used for checking the orientation of GtkProgressBars, and a
   lot more.
 * There is now a small summary of the features of this engine available at
   http://benjamin.sipsolutions.net/Projects/eXperience.
 * The engine now can be compiled with byacc and bison.

04.05.2005 (0.9.4.1)
 * This again fixes a bug in configure.ac. I hope now the PKG_CHECK_MODULES
   line is correct!

01.05.2005 (0.9.4)
 * This version now has right to left locale support. This means there is a
   new option text_orientation, that you can use for i18l.
 * Bumped up the version number, because I believe enough important changes
   have accumulated.

27.04.2005 (0.9.3.4)
 * Ok, this fixes an error in the configure.ac. I missed to put gtk+-2.0
   into PKG_CHECK_MODULES so the engine got linked wrong (it only compiled
   because of a stupid hack). This should fix the linking issue, and all
   apps should look fine again.

18.04.2005 (0.9.3.3)
 * This Version fixes a bug which caused wrong colors sometimes.
   (I wanted to save an hash table lookup, but that doesn't work)

27.03.2005 (0.9.3)
 * Some speedups. Engine doesn't feel much faster though.
 * Fixed bug because of which some icons had color strips.
 * Fixed bug that gaps weren't drawn correctly, if they only needed
   a partial redraw.

25.01.2005
Mostly bugfixes. e.g.
 * Fixed Firefox menu bug
 * some memory leaks.

02.01.2005
This is the first official release of the eXperience GTK-2 engine.
