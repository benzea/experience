 * everywhere where there is a g_assert, should be another check later, so
   that I can compile with G_DISABLE_ASSERT. And if I somehow force a crash
   in some cases.
 * Cleanup the gap drawing code.
 * Add the no_inherit flag to _all_ options.

Big things:
 * cairo port (maybe should wait until cairo 0.5 and for gtk versions that
   depend on cairo)
   cairo 0.5 seem to be out now. so maybe I should get this started soon.
